Description: The ChromeOS EC console interpreter
 EC-3PO is a console interpreter which migrates the rich debug console from the
 EC itself to the host. This allows for a rich debug console without impacting
 EC image sizes while also allowing the development of new console features.

 This libary is for example needed by the chromeos hcdtools to let servo board
 talk to ChromeOS devices.
